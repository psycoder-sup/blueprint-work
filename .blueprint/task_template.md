# Task Template

## Post-Implementation

After implementing code, run the following sequentially:

1. Run **code simplifier** to improve clarity and maintainability.
2. Run **code reviewer** to catch bugs, security issues, and quality problems.
3. Run **tests** (`cargo test`) and **linting** (`cargo clippy`) to verify correctness.
